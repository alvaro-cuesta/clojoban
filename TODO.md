# TODO list

*(ordered by relevance)*

## Planned

 - Better reloading (for programmer comfort.)
 - External config file <- do I REALLY need this
 - Show "goaled" goals in a different fashion
 - Better lein-ring support
 - Use transients instead of refs?
 - Deploy 1.0.0 to production
  - Deploy and release everywhere
  - Document thoroughly in wiki
  - Check for refactor opportunities
 - Button (maybe URL part) to switch themes

## Optional

 - "Click new" message if no session is available instead of forcing new session
 - MongoDB for long-term session storage (using memory as cache for recent sessions)
 - Bindings for Graphics and such?
  - Maybe use Seesaw or craft my own library
 - Remote/custom themes
